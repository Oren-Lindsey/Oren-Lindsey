# Hi, I'm Oren
I'm 14 years old and I live in North Carolina (the best state btw)

## I like to code. 
So far everything I've made is open source and you can see it on here.
Here are my Github Stats:

I mostly make websites. Here are the main languages I use:

I don't know how to use any command line interface. (‚Üê ikr)

## My favorite projects are: 
- [A website for my christmas list](https://github.com/Oren-Lindsey/List-website). This was the first big project I made, although I wouldn't consider it big now.

## Outside of coding
Outside of coding I love Elon Musk and his projects, sneakers, design, streetwear, Apple Tech, Ye music, the outdoors, food, and such. I want a Tesla when I grow up. Also I'm a christian

## Btw
I'm willing to collaborate on a website if you want. Just contact me at one of the above. Also if you need help with js, html, or css then you could ask me. I probably wouldn't be much help though
