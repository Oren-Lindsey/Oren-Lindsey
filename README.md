# Hi, I'm Oren
I'm 14 years old and I live in North Carolina (the best state btw)

## I like to code. 
So far everything I've made is open source and you can see it on here. Also all my stuff is mirrored on gitlab at gitlab.com/Oren-Lindsey.
I mostly make websites. (btw ![javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E) is my favorite language)
Here are my Github Stats:

## My favorite projects are: 
- [A website for my christmas list](https://github.com/Oren-Lindsey/List-website). This was the first big project I made, although I wouldn't consider it big now.
- [A login system](https://github.com/Oren-Lindsey/login). This is something I made recently.
- [wasteof-client](https://github.com/Oren-Lindsey/wasteof-client) A node.js package for [wasteof.money](https://wasteof.money)

## Tech I use:
- Currently I have a ![mac](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apple-MacBook_Pro_2015-333333?style=for-the-badge&logo=apple&logoColor=white) 15 inch Intel i7 w/ 16 gigs memory and 1 TB ssd
- I mostly code on [![Replit](https://img.shields.io/badge/replit-667881?style=for-the-badge&logo=replit&logoColor=white)](https://replit.com), but I'll switch to ![vscode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio_Code-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white) one of these days
- I use ![Safari](https://img.shields.io/badge/Safari-FF1B2D?style=for-the-badge&logo=Safari&logoColor=white) for normal internet browsing and ![Chrome](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google_chrome-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=Google-chrome&logoColor=white) for [![Scratch](https://img.shields.io/badge/Scratch-4D97FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=Scratch&logoColor=white)](https://scratch.mit.edu/)

## Outside of coding
Outside of coding I love Elon Musk and his projects, sneakers, design, streetwear, Apple Tech, Ye music, the outdoors, food, and such. I want a Tesla when I grow up. Also I'm a christian

## Btw
I'm willing to collaborate on a website if you want. Just contact me at one of the above. Also if you need help with js, html, or css then you could ask me. I probably wouldn't be much help though
